# Now with math!
Always learning more... Last night I figured out how to implement math equations. I put my first equation in my previous post on making a [simple fractal](/blog/2022/02/10/simple-fractal). As for how I did it? I gathered information from the following pages:

- [MathJax Local Configuration File](https://vincenttam.github.io/blog/2014/11/09/mathjax-local-configuration-file/)
- [Using mathjax on GitHub Pages with Jekyll ](https://alanduan.me/random/mathjax/)
- [How to add mathjax support to jekyll](http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~zichen2/blog/coding/setup/2019/02/17/how-to-add-mathjax-support-to-jekyll.html)

There is some overlap in these pages but by consulting those pages I was able to configure my site to display math. I had to modify my [default.html](https://github.com/mike-babb/mike-babb.github.io/blob/main/_layouts/default.html) file and my [_config.yml](https://github.com/mike-babb/mike-babb.github.io/blob/main/_config.yml) file. 

# New data!
In a recent interview I was asked to perform some analyses on a dataset from [analytics.usa.gov](https://analytics.usa.gov/). There are datasets featuring snippets of web traffic to US government websites. Some cool stuff there.
