I just updated my [project](https://github.com/mike-babb/finding_anagrams) showing how [NumPy's](https://numpy.org/) arrays and other python objects can be used to [Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) parent/child word-relationship data into a SQLite database, A parent/child word relationship is one where some or all of the letters of a focal word can be used to spell another word: an anagram! 

See this [page](/media/finding_anagrams/word_grid.html) for an interactive graphic showing some of the parent/child word relationships.

V1.0 can be found [here](https://mike-babb.github.io/blog/2022/02/24/finding-anagrams).

The difference between this version and pervious versions is an expanded set of parent/child word determination techniques and better delineated techniques. There were four techniques in v1.0 and six techniques in v2.0. Each of the six techniques produce the same output: the identification and storage of approximately 73M parent-child word pairs. This project was motivated by my desire to learn more about [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and over time morphed into *how* quickly and efficiently I could identify the parent/child word pairs. Briefly, each of the six techniques involves subdivision of a $[216K, 26]$ matrix into $1$ or more sub-matrices of size $[M, 26]$

The six techniques are listed below along with a brief description and how long it takes to identify the parent/child word pairs. In general, the techniques progress from naive matrix sub-division to more efficient sub-division of the $[216K, 26]$ matrix.

| Matrix Extraction Option | Subdivision Description | Total Time |
| -----:|:-----|-----:|
| 1 | No subdivision  | 1 h 33 m 50 s |
| 2 | Word length | 49 m 33 s |
| 3 | First letter| 35 m 27 s |
| 4 | Single least common letter | 15 m 29 s |
| 5 | Three least common letters | 3 m 2 s |
| 6 | Three least common letters and word length |3 m 39 s |

Yes, techniques 5 and 6 really are 30 times faster than option 1! As for specific reasons why? Well, I'll recommend the project's thorough (and verbose) [README.md](https://github.com/mike-babb/finding_anagrams/blob/main/README.md) for information that answers that question. There are lots of graphics describing the differences in the timing and the size of the sub-matrices generated by each matrix extraction technique.

If you have any ideas for an additional sub-division technique, please let me know. I have no doubt there are additional possibilities out there. Is a sub-minute determination possible? Perhaps a wholly different technique or a different hardware implementation such as using a [GPU-accelerated version of NumPY](https://cupy.dev/) could be used to crack the sub-minute determination.
