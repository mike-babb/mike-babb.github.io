# I just want to type!
So do I... So do I... And this is the impetus for this entry: how should we be doing technical documents? 

# MS Word
It works. It works? It works! I'm currently editing a document that I did not create. The person who created this document is submitting this document on A4 paper. There are a lot of tables and figures. It's a dissertation. I know, I know. I love working on dissertations so much that I started working on another one! Ha, ha, but yes and no. I love helping graduate students. And I get working with MS Word. 

## Figures and tables
That being said. I am in the delightful throes of working with figures and tables in MS Word. It is a special kind of madness. Throw in track changes and wowza. Like Depeche Mode said, ["things get damaged"](https://genius.com/Depeche-mode-precious-lyrics)*.

*I know this song is not about dissertations. But I believe the record will show that I love making meaning out everything.
