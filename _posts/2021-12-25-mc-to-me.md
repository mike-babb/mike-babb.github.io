Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

It took about 30 minutes to get this working. Still not sure of the delay between committing to git and changes being reflected on the live site.
