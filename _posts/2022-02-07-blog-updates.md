# Programming for the interwebs!

I am learning a lot.

After I launched this blog in January, I set out to publish some advice on how I finished grad school. I just published my, what turned out to be a five part series on how I finished grad school. Just typing  
that out loud makes me laugh.

Clearly, it took a while to type that up. But! That's not why I'm writing this post. I'm writing this post because I wanted to add a "last update field" to my posts. So many things are iterative! And I want to put stuff out sooner rather than later. And I realize that one of the things preventing that is an update date. I'll start a post, but it won't be complete until a few days later. I don't want to keep updating the date field in the markdown's header. Of course, there is a plugin for that. Yay for jekyll! It took me a while to understand how to configure the plugin and in the process I learned a little bit more about jekyll.

The plugin is called [jekyll-last-modified-at](https://github.com/gjtorikian/jekyll-last-modified-at). And this [page](https://tomkadwill.com/adding-last-modified-date-to-jekyll) features a little more information on how to implement the plugin. Both pages feature instructions and once I understood a little bit more about how to build a webpage using jekyll, the instructions make a lot of sense. I'm approaching web development as a complete novice. So, here is what I did:

## Install the pluggin
Follow the instructions at [https://github.com/gjtorikian/jekyll-last-modified-at](https://github.com/gjtorikian/jekyll-last-modified-at).

## Update the post.html template
I used the code from this [page](https://tomkadwill.com/adding-last-modified-date-to-jekyll) to modify the post.html template. I would showcase what my [post.html](https://github.com/mike-babb/mike-babb.github.io/blob/main/_layouts/post.html) template looks likes with a code block, but I can't seem to include the code as an example and not have the code render. (The markdown is rendering what is included in the code block so it's pulling in additional stuff from elsewhere in blog. I do not know why. Yet...) 

So, I still have some things to learn. And in that regard I'll take a queue from my motivation for adding the last update date feature and publish anyway!
