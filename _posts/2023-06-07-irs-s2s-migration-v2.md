# State-to-State Migration data: v2.0

Version 2.0 of the IRS state-to-state migration data! This iteration features an expanded record count and more thorough metadata. In total, I imported 173,442 records: half incoming records and half outgoing records. Of those, 91-percent are state-to-state migration records and the remaining 9-percent are various other totals such as the number of non-migrants, number of foreign returns, and other sub-totals.

Stay tuned for a version 3.0.
