# Cooling off in the desert
I'm currently in Scottsdale, AZ for the 61st Annual meeting of the [Western Regional Science Association](https://www.wrsaonline.org/newsite/). I am presenting a chapter from my dissertation. Specifically, my first empirical chapter on enhancing the IRS's county-to-county household migration data. So far, I am really enjoying myself. 

I arrived on Thursday and I head back to Seattle on Tuesday.
