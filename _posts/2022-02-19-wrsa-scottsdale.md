# Cooling off in the desert
I'm currently in Scottsdale, AZ for the 61st Annual meeting of the [Western Regional Science Association](https://www.wrsaonline.org/newsite/). I am presenting a chapter from my dissertation. Specifically, my first empirical chapter on enhancing the IRS's county-to-county household migration data. So far, I am really enjoying myself. 

I arrived on Thursday and I head back to Seattle on Tuesday. 

# Going back home and initial thoughts...

What a great time! I've had a lot of fun. I'm currently in my hotel room, packing for tomorrow, drinking a grapefruit white claw, and reflecting. It's been a great trip. I'm going to fly into Paine Field, an airport north of SEA-TAC. 

I had tacos. I walked. I had tiki drinks. The tacos and the walks were great, the tiki drinks were less so. I know how to make a martini and a daiquiri like none other (recipe to follow). I think I will develop my mai tai skills.
