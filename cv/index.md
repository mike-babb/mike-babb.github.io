## Occupation

`January 2016 - Present`\
_Data Scientist_\
University of Washington
- Design and implementation, in python and R, of data engineering pipelines using linear optimization and regression modelling resulting in a 30-percent increase in the study population (136M to 178M) and an 8-fold increase in complete cases.
- Deployment of 155K generalized linear models in a parallelized R computing environment.
- Design and implementation in R of parallelized data visualization pipelines.
Data engineering, regression modelling, and visualization of historical and contemporary using python, R, and SQLite.
- Consultation and instruction in feature engineering, data analysis, geospatial analysis, statistical analysis, data visualization, and cartographic visualization using python, R, and ArcGIS.

`August 2013 – January 2016`\
_GIS Analyst_\
Zillow.com
- Authorship of geospatial feature engineering and machine learning algorithms in python, R and MS SQL Server.
- Feature engineering and statistical analyses in support of live-site operations and maintenance using MS SQL Server and python.
- Data-driven analysis of the technical feasibility and business-need suitability of dataset acquisition and incorporation into production, at-scale, machine learning pipelines.
- Authorship of new geospatial feature engineering algorithms in R and python that led to a 10-fold increase over then-existing algorithm efficiency and coverage.
- Data-driven business-needs assessment of the strengths and efficiencies of existing geospatial feature engineering algorithms.
Used R to perform diagnostics of model output leading to the identification of biases in production machine learning models.

`April 2012 – October 2014`\
_Geographer_\
U.S. Bureau of Census
- Coordinated federal-academic project proposal development, project management, and researcher access to confidential federal statistical data.
- Site operation and administration of a Federal Statistical Research Data Center.
- Completed build out and received certification to operate a federally compliant Federal Statistical Research Data Center (1 of 16 at the time of opening).
