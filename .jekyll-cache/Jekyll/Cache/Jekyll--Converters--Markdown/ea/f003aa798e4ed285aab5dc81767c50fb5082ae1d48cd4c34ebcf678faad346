<p>So, I finished my PhD and I find myself looking for a job. A time of uncertainty, ups, and downs. Irrespective of that, I am reflecting on and grateful for how many people I have in my life that have offered to help in some form or another.</p>

<p>That’s so cool. And that really makes me happy.</p>
