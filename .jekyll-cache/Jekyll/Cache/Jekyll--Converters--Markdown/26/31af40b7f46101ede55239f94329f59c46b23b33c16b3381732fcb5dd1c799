I"1<p>My journey through graduate school was a long one. Filled with many ups and downs and many diversions. Some by design, some by circumstance. In 2020 I discovered the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/">r/PhD</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/">r/DissertationSupport</a>, and the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/">r/GradSchool</a> subreddits. It was phenomenal to see what other graduate students were working on and going through and be able to offer some advice. I gathered some of my posts and expanded upon them. I’ve also shared some of this information with other graduate students in person and this blog post is my way of collecting that information in one spot and making making it more available.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-help-you-finish">“How can I help you finish?”</h2>
<p>A dear friend asked me how he could help me finish. As did another! That feeling of support was unparalleled. That’s what got me going – but it’s not what got me through. This is a dissertation – friends and family will encourage you. But, they won’t do it for you. People are in your corner and they want to see you suceed.</p>

<h2 id="dissertation-journal">Dissertation journal</h2>
<p>This is the number one way I finished. I began every entry the same way: the date, the time, the physical location I was in, and what drink I was consuming. Sometimes I would make multiple entries per day. But all entries were the same: date, time, place, drink.</p>

<p>I used my dissertation journal to track everything:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What I needed to accomplish on a given day</li>
  <li>What I wanted to accomplish on a given day</li>
  <li>What was bothering me</li>
  <li>How I felt about the process</li>
  <li>Half-baked ideas</li>
  <li>Drafts of portions of chapters</li>
  <li>Citations I needed to gather at a later date and time</li>
  <li>Interesting/useful/relevant URLs</li>
  <li>Drafts of graphics.</li>
</ul>

<p>It all went into my dissertation journal. I’ve learned from this process that I can only remember so much and I only really want to remember so much. Writing the ephemeral and transitory down helped me keep track of the bigger picture. Plus, it was phenomenal to look back and see where I was stuck and how I resolved it and what I was worried about and what made me happy.</p>

<p>I used <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onenote/digital-note-taking-app">Microsoft’s OneNote</a> as my dissertation journal. I like OneNote’s interface on my laptop and it syncs seemlessly with the iPhone and iPad add. Because of this, my journal was always with me. Late night ideas, flashes of insight while standing in the grocery store line, some model parameter I realized I needed to check while out on a walk, the dissertation journal captured them all because I had portable access.</p>

<p>This is the number one way I finished: my dissertation journal. And this is what I share with other graduate students. Start a dissertation journal. For me, it was both a log of whay I did each day, what I wanted to accomplish, and how I wrote about writing.</p>

<h2 id="use-software-that-helps">Use software that helps</h2>
<p>I settled on a particular eco-system of software that helped me finish. Was any one piece of software outstanding? Not really. I used Microsoft OneNote for my dissertation journal because I can access it from my computer, iPhone, iPad, and from a browser. This helped make my dissertation journal more available and ready if I needed to get a bunch of anxious or scattered thoughts out of my head. That being said, I also bought a nice notebook and a <a href="https://uni-pens.com/product/jetstream-4and1/">4-color pen</a>. Somedays I wrote my dissertation journal out by hand and multi-colored doodles.</p>

<p>While software can help, beware of the “new-tool” or the “perfect-tool” trap. There will always be a new tool. It might be better. It might be worse. But all tools are equally worthless if they are not used to create. Pick one and get creating. If you don’t like it, chances are you can port your work to a new tool. But, you have to pick one and keep going. I’ve definitely lost a lot of time investing in some new software because I thought it would solve all of my problems. Certainly, my dissertation journal helped me solved a lot of my problems. But that was a technique and an action - not OneNote specifically. I could have written my journal in MS Excel, or MS Word, or MS Access (ha!), or in a plain text editor. It was the action that help me finish.</p>

<p>It’s poor form to say that the “one thing” preventing you from working is not having the perfect setup. There is a great deal of revision in a dissertation, including how you work.</p>

<h2 id="something-is-better-than-nothing">Something is better than nothing</h2>
<p>At the beginning of each day, I would ask myself, what am I going to do to push this forward? This was especially useful if I was stuck.
At the end of each day, I would ask myself, how did I push this project forward?</p>

<p>Somedays it was just a paragraph of text. Somedays it was mock-up of a graphic or a map that I had in my head I wanted to get out and build a narrative around.
Somedays it was jotting down ideas that would coalesce into a section of a chapter.</p>

<p>Even if some thread or idea did not ultimately pan out, I still pushed the project forward becasue I learned something.</p>

<h2 id="write-every-day">Write every day</h2>
<p>Some days I’d write pages and pages of text, and some days it would be just a paragraph or even just a sentence. But working every day was key to keeping the momentum going.</p>

<p><em>Momentum and motivation follow action</em></p>

<p>Dissertations are completed one page, one paragraph, one sentence, one word, and one keystroke at time. Incremental, daily, progress does wonders.</p>

<h2 id="just-write">Just write</h2>
<p>Write first, edit later. Alternatively, do not be precious about the text. Shunt what doesn’t work into a document that you could come back to later. Just put text down. 
My as-submitted dissertation clocks in at 51K words, excluding references. I have another document called “extra_text.docx” that features an additional 25K words. So, an additional half-dissertation. Thoughts and ideas that didn’t make the cut. I do not lament that “extra work”. That extra work was necessary to sharpen my thoughts and help me articulate my ideas. In a sense, my dissertation journal helped me with my writing. Just put text down.</p>

<p>Somedays, I was stuck and I just start describing a graphic I made. Or I would articulate some aspect of my data. Or, if I felt brave, I would start a lit-review from memory and write a chronological overview of the methods and theoretical subject matter of my data.</p>

<p><em>Just. Write.</em></p>

<h2 id="keep-going">Keep going</h2>
<p>The more I worked on this, the better I got at working on it. And to some extent, the easier it became. That’s not to say it was easy. It wasn’t. This was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. But I kept going. As trite and obvious as it sounds, that was how I finished. I kept going.</p>

<h2 id="on-the-other-side-of-suffering-is-greatness">On the other side of suffering is greatness</h2>
<p>This is a phrase from <a href="https://davidgoggins.com/">David Goggins</a>. Former Navy SEAL and ultra athlete. Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9YhjPP3b2s&amp;ab_channel=Mindvalley">video</a> of him describing this idea. He also has a phenomenal <a href="https://davidgoggins.com/book/">book</a>.</p>

<p>This is the most controversial aspect of this guide.</p>

<p>Throughout all of my years in graduate school, the three roaring, deafening, frequently all-consuming, near-constant thoughts I had in my head were that I am weak, I am a fraud, and my work is no good. Most people would call this imposter syndrome. Fine. And nearly all university pamphlets and leaflets and websites and guides on imposter syndrome offer some mix of about a dozen different ways of overcoming it or dealing with. And I hope those pamphelets work for people. But none of them did for me.</p>

<p>What worked for me was acknowledging thsoe voices. What got me through the last and most difficult part of the dissertation process was listening to that fucking voice in my head and embracing that motherfucker. Many of those guides on imposter syndrome say to have compassion for yourself and in those guides having compassion for yourself means not listening to that voice and ignoring those thoughts.</p>

<p>But what if those thoughts are telling you the truth? What if having compassion for yourself is listening to yourself?</p>

<p>For years I ignored those voices, to some success. But, by listening to those voices and admitting that they were right set me free of their tyranny. By finally believing those voices I gained a sense of power and motivation like I had never felt before. It was rather immediate, over about a week of listening to those voices I realized they were right. I am weak, I am a fraud, and my work is no good. I used to be terrified of writing that down. Of admitting that. But that truth set me free. 
Because by admitting that I set a zero-point. 
I am weak. I want to be strong.
I am a fraud. I want to be genuine.
My work is no good. I want my work to be good.</p>

<p>The way for me to become strong, to be genuine, to produce quality work was to finish this dissertation. And I was fucking right. What I didn’t realize at the beginning of this project is that working on this dissertation helped me become stronger, more genuine, and a more competent worker. Every line of code, every map I made, every sentence I wrote, every paragraph of text. Little by little, these infinitesimally small actions made me stronger, more honest, and more competent. And by admitting that I was weak, a fraud, and an incompetent worker, I could see and establish the starting point and move forward.</p>

<p>We’re researchers and scientists. Our job is to build new knowledge out of existing knowledge. Sometimes that new knowledge means casting away the existing knowledge.</p>

<p>You will only find peace by going to war with yourself.</p>

<p>I am strong, I am genuine, and my work is good. The PhD was a milestone. I will only reach the next milestone through challenge and</p>

That and organizing my references and citations. The more organized I was with that, the easier it was to write.</p>

<h2 id="dreamsidealsreality-where-is-the-disconnect">Dreams/Ideals/reality: Where is the disconnect?</h2>
<p>All throughout my time in grad school, I had this dream that I would ride my bike to a park or a beach. I would leave at a civilized time in the morning, around 8 am or so, and read for a few hours, grab a coffee on the way home, and really delight in this process. I did that a few times, certainly less than 10. But every year this dream would resurface – especially at the end of Spring quarter. I’d always say, “maybe this is the year”. Again, I did that, but not really. I had this dream that I would do that twice a week. Tuesdays and Thursdays. But I never did that. So, what was the hold up?
Papers and books are heavy.
Parks are dirty and windy.
But maybe I didn’t want that?</p>
