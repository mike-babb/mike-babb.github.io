<p>I am learning a lot.</p>

<p>After I launched this blog in January, I set out to publish some advice on how I finished grad school. I just published my, what turned out to be a five part series on how I finished grad school. Just typing<br />
that out loud makes me laugh.</p>

<p>Clearly, it took a while to type that up. But! That‚Äôs not why I‚Äôm writing this post. I‚Äôm writing this post because I wanted to add a ‚Äúlast update field‚Äù to my posts. So many things are iterative! And I want to put stuff out sooner rather than later. And I realize that one of the things preventing that is an update date. I‚Äôll start a post, but it won‚Äôt be complete until a few days later. I don‚Äôt want to keep updating the date field in the markdown‚Äôs header. Of course, there is a plugin for that. Yay for jekyll! It took me a while to understand how to configure the pluging and in the process I learned a little bit more about jekyll.</p>

<p>The plugin is called <a href="https://github.com/gjtorikian/jekyll-last-modified-at">jekyll-last-modified-at</a>. And this <a href="https://tomkadwill.com/adding-last-modified-date-to-jekyll">page</a> features a little more information on how to implement the plugin. Both pages feature instructions and once I understood a little bit more about how to build a webpage using jekyll, the instructions make a lot of sense. I‚Äôm approaching web development as a complete novice. So, here is what I did:</p>

<h2 id="install-the-pluggin">Install the pluggin</h2>
<p>Follow the instructions at <a href="https://github.com/gjtorikian/jekyll-last-modified-at">https://github.com/gjtorikian/jekyll-last-modified-at</a>.</p>

<h2 id="update-the-posthtml-template">Update the post.html template</h2>
<p>I used the code from this <a href="https://tomkadwill.com/adding-last-modified-date-to-jekyll">page</a> to modify the post.html template. I would showcase what my post.html template looks likes, but I can‚Äôt seem to include the code as an example but not have the code render.</p>

<p>So, I still have some things to learn. And in that regad I‚Äôll take a queue from my motivation for adding the last update date feature and publish anyway!</p>
