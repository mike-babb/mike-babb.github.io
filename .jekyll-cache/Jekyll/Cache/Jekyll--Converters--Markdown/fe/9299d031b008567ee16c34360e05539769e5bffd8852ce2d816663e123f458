<p>Always learning moreâ€¦ Last night I figured out how implement math equations. I put my first equation in my previous post on making a <a href="/blog/2022/02/10/simple-fractal">simple fractal</a>. As for how I did it? I gathered information from the following pages:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://vincenttam.github.io/blog/2014/11/09/mathjax-local-configuration-file/">MathJax Local Configuration File</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://alanduan.me/random/mathjax/">Using mathjax on GitHub Pages with Jekyll </a></li>
  <li><a href="http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~zichen2/blog/coding/setup/2019/02/17/how-to-add-mathjax-support-to-jekyll.html">How to add mathjax support to jekyll</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There is some overlap in these pages but by consulting them I was able to configure my site to display math. I had to modify my <a href="https://github.com/mike-babb/mike-babb.github.io/blob/main/_layouts/default.html">default.html</a> file and my <a href="https://github.com/mike-babb/mike-babb.github.io/blob/main/_config.yml">_config.yml</a> file.</p>

<p>In an recent interview I was asked to perform some analyses on a dataset from <a href="https://analytics.usa.gov/">analytics.usa.gov</a>. There are datasets featuring snippets of web traffic to US government websites. Some cool stuff there.</p>
