<p>Iâ€™m currently in Scottsdale, AZ for the 61st Annual meeting of the <a href="https://www.wrsaonline.org/newsite/">Western Regional Science Association</a>. I am presenting a chapter from my dissertation. Specifically, my first empirical chapter on enhancing the IRSâ€™s county-to-county household migration data. So far, I am really enjoying myself.</p>

<p>I arrived on Thursday and I head back to Seattle on Tuesday.</p>
