I"ª<h1 id="still-vba">Still VBA?</h1>
<p>This is an exploratory post. In a nutshell, I need to automate some processes in Outlook. I know I can do that with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). And I have. As a matter of fact, VBA was the first programming language I learned. So, in that regard, I‚Äôve been using VBA for close to 20 years! I was tasked with automating some processes in ArcMap. I think it was version 8.3. Python, while on the scene, wasn‚Äôt the most robust. And the GIS shop I was interning with built custom applications using VBA. So I learned VBA. A year or two later I learned that the Microsoft Office Applications have a built in VBA editors (Alt+F11, anyone?). These are usually called macros. While bad guys the world have used macros to comprise computers and run malicious code, I have used these macros to extract data and apply formatting.</p>

<p>Since then, I‚Äôve learned a few more. And one constant between ALL programming languages I‚Äôve used is that each programming language requries a different way of thinking. Sometimes there are collisions between the design of one language and another. For example, I sometimes think that ESRI, seeing the rise of python, ported the VBA object model to python. I say this without any confirmation, but because the ArcPy library is such a different way of working with python (it‚Äôs <em>very</em> hierarchical) that it sometimes doesn‚Äôt feel like python. But that‚Äôs a different topic for a different time.</p>

<p>Back to automating outlook! In particular, I‚Äôd like to read all of my calendar entries and pipe them to a database. I‚Äôve built this code before, it‚Äôs currently on my hard drive (maybe in a git repo somewhere). But what database do I use? Well, SQLite would be nice, but that‚Äôs a little more difficult than piping to an MS Access. That‚Äôs right: we‚Äôre using VBA with MS Access to read an outlook file and save the entries to Outlook! Why did I do this? The short answer is that it‚Äôs the most straightforward. The longer answer is multifaceted:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I spend a lot of time in Outlook.</li>
  <li>Many times over the years, I have had to keep track of my hours.</li>
  <li>I dislike entering the same data in multiple spot.</li>
  <li>I desperately want to minimize the time I spend reporting my time.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, 10-plus years ago I built a tool that reads my outlook calendar entries, parses the entries, and dumps the output to a database. From the database, I can then quickly generate an excel file to send to a client. Even better when I can build a form in MS Access, and click one button to generate a report. So that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done and over the years I‚Äôve tweaked.</p>

<p>I have no doubt there are other programs out there that do this same thing. Mostly likely web based, offer some propriatry technology, and come with steep subscription fees. The hell with that.</p>

<p>My real innovatation is that I can use VBA‚Äôs limited string parsing library to format the data during extract. And the way this really plays out is the careful use of delimiters. I‚Äôve found that nearly all of my time can be categorized as ‚Äúcategory - activity.‚Äù The category can be anything: a project, a class in college, a client, family, friends, or general to do. The activity is something germane to each category. For example: prepare map of the eastside development areas, write up chapter three notes, update slide deck for management presentation, buy a cake for mom, buy a cake for Tim, and take out the garbage. And outlook lets you segment your calendar into 15 minute chunks. This has always been an interesting way to think about time, my work, and what I engage with on each day.</p>

<p>I just opened my Access database and it looks like my code still works.</p>

<p>The cool part about this that I built is that I can import my calendar entries, my email, my tasks, my contacts, and my notes.</p>

<p>According to my DB, I have about 1.8K appointments defined. It takes a little less than a minute to import the appointments.</p>

<p>The downside is that it‚Äôs slow. Such is VBA. Is there something faster? I would love to know! A different language? Is it my ten year old code? Could I query the server directly?</p>
