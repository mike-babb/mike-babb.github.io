<p>I work better in some spaces and places than others and that is influenced by the time of day or night.</p>

<p>I really like working in cafes, libraries, and bars at night. The pandemic made that very difficult. I lost access to my favorite spaces and places during lockdown. Working from one desk at home proved difficult. So I improvised by putting in an additional small desk near a sunny window in my apartment. I grew to really like that small desk. Iâ€™d make a coffee and it felt a little like being at a cafe. Sometimes, Iâ€™d work at my kitchen table and sip a martini while I wrote late into the night.Those different spaces and places helped me be productive in their own way. Find yours.</p>

<p>Is it dual monitors? A de-cluttered desk? A standing desk? Experiment and find out. Sometimes I needed two-monitors. Sometimes that was a distraction and I got more done on a single laptop screen than on two huge monitors. Several years ago I purchased a standing desk. Itâ€™s great! I like standing and working. Especially for more rote tasks. However, Iâ€™ve found that I carry out deep-brain required tasks better if I am sitting. So I move between work stations a lot. Accordingly, I strive to make each space I work in pleasant.</p>

<h3 id="some-of-us-are-night-owls"><em>Some of us are night-owls.</em></h3>
<p>Sometimes, my anxious, unfocused energy means that I am working for many hours but I do not get anything done. Bursts of activity, dozens of answered emails and text messages, half-started and half-finished data processing functions and paragraphs. But I didnâ€™t do anything that pushed the important stuff forward. This used to frustrate me a great deal. At some point in time over the last few years, I leaned into it. I learned that after exhausting that anxious, unfocused energy I was remarkably clear headed and I would have laser-like focus. The evening lift, as I call it, would usually occur around 8 pm. The work that I would get done between the hours of 8 pm and 12 am was truly inspired. Sometimes I was having such a good time with that focus and my work that I would step out to a local cafe with a quiet atmosphere and treat myself to a boilermaker. Drink some beer, drink some whiskey, and put down reams of code or paragraphs of text.</p>

<h2 id="pomodoro">Pomodoro</h2>
<h3 id="short-periods-of-work-short-breaks"><em>Short periods of work, short breaks</em></h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">The Pomodoro technique</a></p>

<p>Small bursts of work, small breaks. It adds up!</p>

<p>One pomodoro is a period of work puncuated by a small break, repeated four times. After the fourth round of work, one takes a longer break.</p>

<p>This technique was especially helpful on the days I had trouble starting or I just didnâ€™t want to work. The typical recommendation is working for 25 minutes followed by a 5-10 minute break. In truth, working for 25 minutes (when I was tired or anxious or bored) before a break did not seem feasible. So, I dialed my work-period back to 12 minutes with a 3 minute break. At the end of the fourth round of work, I would take a 15 minute break.</p>

<p>I got so much work done because of this technique. And that was on some days where I didnâ€™t want to work at all! The first round was the toughest, but it always got me going. I can always work for 12 minutes. 12 MINUTES! Thatâ€™s such a short period of time. I can do anything for 12 minutes. And I did!</p>

<p>And the breaks were incredibly helpful. I would stop working and do something else for a few minutes. Get a drink of water, fold a few clothes, tidy my desk, make my bed. It was great! I wrote pages of text and I organized my place. The breaks allowed me to channel my fidgity energy into something productive.</p>

<p>And somedays, especially after a rough start, it became a bit of a game. How much work could I get done in 12 minutes? Could I put down a paragraph of coherent text in 12 minutes? Could I write a function that returns what I need? That was kind of cool.</p>

<p>Most days, after a few pomodoros I found a grove, turned off the pomodoros, and kept working. Some days, the pomodoros helped me chanel my energy. Some days I was too scattered to focus and the 12-minute bursts helped me get it done.</p>

<h3 id="get-creative"><em>Get creative!</em></h3>
<p>Sometimes when I was stuck or feeling uninspired I would make a map or other data visualization. For me, the mapping and the data visualization is when I felt most creative and most productive. My favorite part was picking the colors and refining line weights to make the graphics come alive. Sometimes the graphics would end up in a chapter and sometimes they would answer a linger question about my data. Iâ€™ll never forget the day I was stuck writing the justification for a chapter. I was getting frustrated and decided to switch to a data analysis problem I had been thinking about for the previous week. I went to my favorite coffee shop, drank coffee, and worked for a very pleasant few hours. I realized the best way to address the data analysis problem was to prepare a visualization of the issue. After making and refining the graphic I realized that the graphic featured justification for one of my empirical chapters. I then went to one of my favorite bars to celebrate with a mai-tai, tweak the graphic a little more, and put down some initial remarks describing the graphic. That was a great night.</p>

<p>Sometimes Iâ€™ve found that working backwards can help me think about a section of a chapter. If I am at a loss for words, Iâ€™ll start thinking about the visualizations, try out a few, and from there Iâ€™ll start building a narrative around those visualizations. And from that narrative I can then refine other sections of the chapter.</p>

<p>Donâ€™t want to think about your dissertation? Get a side project! Iâ€™ve been known to do <del>a little</del> a lot of procrasti-working. Try and make the side-project beneficial. Maybe itâ€™s work for a different chapter? Or a fun project that will help you skill up? Or a dataset you wanted to explore? Or an odd/unclear/fun concept you wanted to visualize?</p>

<p>Get a side-project! I started working on an <a href="https://github.com/mike-babb/finding_anagrams">anagram finder using python</a>. It was a lot of fun to tinker with code in a no-stakes environment.</p>
