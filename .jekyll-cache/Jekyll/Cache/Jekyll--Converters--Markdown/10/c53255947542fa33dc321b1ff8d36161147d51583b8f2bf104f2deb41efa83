I"Â<p>My journey through graduate school was a long one. Filled with many ups and downs and many diversions. Some by design, some by circumstance. In 2020 I discovered the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/">r/PhD</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/">r/DissertationSupport</a>, and the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/">r/GradSchool</a> subreddits. It was phenomenal to see what other graduate students were working on and going through and be able to offer some advice. I gathered some of the advice I shared in my posts and expnded upon them. I‚Äôve also shared some of this information with other graduate students in person and this blog post is my way of collecting that information in one spot and making making it more available. Another reason I am sharing this advice because some of the collected wisdom on ‚Äúhow to do graduate school‚Äù did not work for me. I found some of it counterproductive.</p>

<p>I know every person‚Äôs journey through graduate school is deeply personal and unique. Some of this advice might be helpful and some of it might be not. Take it with a teaspoon of salt or ignore it. If any of it is helpful, fantastic. If not, well, thank you for reading.</p>

<p>There is nothing discipline or topic specific to the pieces of advice in these sections. I used quantitative methods and processed a great deal in my dissertion so some of the advice is geared to that.</p>

<p>My list originally featured about eight things I did that helped me finished. But like most projects, it got larger. As I wroted I realized there were more things I did to help me finish. The list grew to include more than 20 and I have organized those items into four categories and each category is a seperate post.</p>
