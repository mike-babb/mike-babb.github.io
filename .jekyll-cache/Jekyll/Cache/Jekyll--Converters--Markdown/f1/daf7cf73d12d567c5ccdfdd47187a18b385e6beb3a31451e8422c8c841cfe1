<p>I’m currently in Scottsdale, AZ for the 61st Annual meeting of the <a href="https://www.wrsaonline.org/newsite/">Western Regional Science Association</a>. I am presenting a chapter from my dissertation. Specifically, my first empirical chapter on enhancing the IRS’s county-to-county household migration data. So far, I am really enjoying myself.</p>

<p>I arrived on Thursday and I head back to Seattle on Tuesday.</p>

What a great time! I’ve had a lot of fun. I’m currently in my hotel room, packing for tomorrow, drinking a grapefruit white claw, and reflecting. It’s been a great trip. I’m going to fly into Paine Field, an airport north of SEA-TAC.</p>

<p>I had tacos. I walked. I had tiki drinks. The tacos and the walks were great, the tiki drinks were less so. I know how to make a martini and a daiquiri like none other (recipes to follow). I think I will develop my mai tai skills.</p>
