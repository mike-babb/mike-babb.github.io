<p>How can we can discover and formalize relationships between words? For example, how can we determine that the words â€˜emitâ€™, â€˜itemâ€™, â€˜miteâ€™, and â€˜timeâ€™ are anagrams? That is, the letters in each of those words in this group can be rearranged to spell a different word. How many word groups are there? Further more, how can we determine that some of the letters in the word â€˜terminatorâ€™ can be used to spell â€˜emitâ€™ (or â€˜itemâ€™, or â€˜miteâ€™, or â€˜timeâ€™, or other words)?</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mike-babb/finding_anagrams">finding anagrams workshop</a> accomplishes two tasks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Finding exact anagrams: the valid combinations of letters in the â€˜emitâ€™ word group</li>
  <li>Discovering and formalizing from/to word relationships: the word â€˜emitâ€™ can be spelled using letters in the word â€˜terminatorâ€™.</li>
</ul>
