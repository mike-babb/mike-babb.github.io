    <h2>"Any day that I can make a map is a good day."</h2>
    <p>
        The above expressed sentiment is something I've come to learn about myself and how I work.

        <br>
        I generate understanding and meaning through mapping and visualization and I motivate 
        projects forward through mapping and visualization.
        </br>

        <br>
        If I can produce a map at the end of a workflow I am tremendously happy. Even if the map is a rough
        draft or a one-off, some mapping is better than no mapping.
        </br>

        <br>
        My favorite days involve my ideal workflow: producing a map from an undifferentiated mass of data.
        </br>
        <br>
        I enjoy - and prefer - using a suite of open source tools to accomplish these tasks.
        My favorite tools to accomplish these tasks are <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">R</a> and
        <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>, <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>,
        <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a>, and
        <a href="https://qgis.org/en/site/">QGIS</a>.

        narrative </h2>
    <p>
        I have over 15 years of experience of working with unstructured and undifferentiated data,
        leveraging the power and utility of a relational database, conducting a series of analyses, visualizing the
        results, and reporting my findings.
        <br>
        <br>

        Previously, I worked worked for the United States Census Bureau and several Seattle-based companies such as
        Zillow, Community Attributes, and Integral GIS. Most recently, at the University of Washington, I was a consulating data scientist with the
        Center for Social Science Computation and Research, a cartography and spatial analysis instructor
        with the Department of Geography, and a research scientist with the e-Science Institute and the
        Center for Studies in Demography and Ecology.

        I'm best known as the guy with the Autobots jacket. Maybe you've seen me?
        <br>
        I've also been known to wear a Navy blue sport coat. How about that one?
